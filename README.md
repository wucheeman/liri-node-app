# LIRI!

## What the project does
This is an implementation of LIRI, the Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command-line Node.js application that retrives data from Twitter, Spotify, or OMDB. It was built as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp.

## How to get started with the application
To enjoy searching with Liri, you must have Node.js installed on your computer, and you will need API keys for Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB. Once those tasks are done, download the application from GitHub and open a terminal window in the same directory. The command prompt is shown as '$'. Enter:

  $ npm install

NPM will install required modules. You must next create a '.env' file with the required keys; look in the file 'liri.js' (Initializations section) to see how the data should be formatted. After this is completed, you're ready to go! Enter:

  $ node liri.js

and choose the task that you want Liri to undertake for you.

## Authors
This instance of Liri was built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and will not be available.
