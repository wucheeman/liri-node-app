# LIRI!

## What the project does
This is an implementation of LIRI, the Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node application that retrives data from Twitter, Spotify, or OMDB. It is being built as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. Comments on the app and code will be added here when it is complete.

## How to get started with the application
This README will be updated with instructions on how to use LIRI eventually, but it's not yet ready.

## Authors
This instance of Liri is being built and will be maintained by Mark Hainline. Help should not be needed, and will not be available.
